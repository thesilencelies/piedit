Piedit is a Graphical IDE and integrated interpreter for the [Piet programming language](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html).

Piet is an esoteric programming language inspired by [Piet Mondrian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian), where the programs look like abstract art. The colours and arrangement of the pixels control the program flow and operation. For a more detailed explanation, see the [Piet Homepage](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html).

Written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) with a [GTK](http://www.gtk.org/) interface designed in [Glade](http://glade.gnome.org/).
